## About this project:

This is a program for teachers, who can have administrative access to their student's track records on their given assignments. Projects, Homework, Academic and other Extra-curricular activities are also available in this program. You can check, view and modify students' track records using this program, and it also provides a great GUI for the user and makes the workspace very simple and organized. 

This project contains many settings files. The reason for this is that if you observe the Main Settings file, you can see a bunch of anchor tags. If you add the links of the sub-settings files to the places of those anchor tags, then it _looks_ like the operations are being processed, and it also makes the atmosphere feel very responsive. Three main headings house about 6 settings in the Main settings file. There are 18 settings present in the program, therefore, there will be 18 sub-settings files in this repository.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> This project contains some blank links, so you should fill in your desired links, desktop and file locations in those blank anchor tags for this project to work as expected.
